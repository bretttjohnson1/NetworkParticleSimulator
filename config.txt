#IFIELD is the initial vector field, leave as rand for random values or write functions of x and y
#VFIELD is the working vector field, it is the same as IFIELD, but it increments the x,y,z velocities by its function value every tick. basically acceleration field
#SIZE is the dimensions of the rectangular prism in x,y,z that houses the points
#PARTICLES is the number of particles
#SPEED is the field that determines how fast the simulation runs, higher speed reduces accuracy
